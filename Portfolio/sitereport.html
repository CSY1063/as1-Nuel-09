         <h2>MY Experience  on the module web development</h2>
         <p>I explored a dynamic area where creativity and functionality collided throughout the web development curriculum. it was a great learningactivity where understanding of creating visually stunning and interactive websites by navigating through HTML, CSS was attained. Every aspect contributed significantly to my experience, from the fundamental framework that the Module delivered to the sophisticated stylistic options that CSS provided. In addition, I was able to gain more insight on both the theoritical and practical aspect of web applications by researching on extra provided materials. This experience sharpened my technical skills and helped me to understand the collaborative aspect of web development, highlighting the value of cooperation and communication in producing dersired results.</p>

         <h2>MY journey on the Project building</h2>
         <p>Embarking on the journey of portfolio building was a transformative experience, encapsulating both self-discovery and skill refinement.  It started with reflection as I determined my interests, strengths, and goals in order to create a portfolio that accurately reflected my experience and knowledge. Although i was still a novice to Coding entirely, i was still determined to make the best out of my little experience. Although it was a rough start, and i had difficulties understanding certain terminologies used withing the web dev environment, i was still able to comprehend a handful of them and still accmulating more knoweledge on how to develop a site. i would in all through my process of designing in this project, CSS was my most diffcult and posed a hard wall to jump when it comes to certain styling and Grid layouts. but the Module slides and extra materials were really helpuly in guiding me through them.</p>
